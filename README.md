Cocktail Party

Welcome to Cocktail Party where you can look through and learn how to make your own Cocktails.
I wanted to make this so that everyone can learn to make the best tasting cocktails.
All the info is available and clear cut for you to see and be able to implement in you cocktail making sessions.

The application allows you to look upon different cocktails that are available and learn how to make them yourself. Each one has a clear cut image and shows which glass each coctail is expected within.

I used axios to pull the data from an API using a GET request and was able to implement that information in my APP.

I faced some issues with retrieving information from the API and had to implement what I could in the mean time.

The app has and easy to use interface with the page load showing a welcome message and a random cocktail button.
The button is there as sometimes you may not want to think too much, and you can click and have something random pop up.
